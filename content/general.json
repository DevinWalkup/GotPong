      "content": "<p>Beer Pong is generally played by teams of two in which each team takes turn throwing a table tennis ball into the other team’s cups. Once a ball lands in a cup, the cup is taken away and the opponent then drinks the contents of the cup.</p><p>If both teammates hit cups, the balls are rolled back and they get to shoot again. The team that successfully hits all of the opponent’s cups wins the game.</p><p>Since there are a vast amount of variation on the game, it is good to quickly go over things like racks and bouncing/swatting before the game begins. Winner of the game typically stays on the table and awaits next challenger.</p>",

If both players miss or both players make it, their partners now shoot.</p><p>This goes on until one person makes it and their opponent does not. The hit cup is not removed; the ball is taken out and rolled back to the team that sank the shot.</p>",
